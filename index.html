        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p id="intro-text">
          Ever since I was young, I was facinated by the world of technology and
          its boundless potential. My curiosity took me across the globe as I
          finished secondary and high school in Singapore, earning a bachelor's
          degree in physics in UK and eventually discovering a love for coding
          here in US. Along the way, I forged friendships with people from
          various cultural backgrounds, honed my skills through hands-on
          projects and internships, and developed a strong scientific mindset
          that now fuels my software development ability. Now that I am about to
          graduate from Duke University, I look forward to leverage my unique
          experiences and skillset to contribute to the evergrowing world of
          software engineering.

          <h3>Design & Development</h3>
          <p class="skill-text">
            I am a hardcore gamer and also a hardcore designer. I design my own
            games, conjure up engaging graphic interfaces and sound effects for
            them. I'm also good at level design, which adds an unique spice to
            my games.

          <h3>Testing</h3>
          <p class="skill-text">
            I am able to deliver well-tested code. In addition, I am also good
            at testing and debuging code written by others. I'm especially good
            at black-testing and I have been contributing in beta testing on
            Steam's greenlight project for over 3 years.
